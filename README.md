a port of the "Better Rolls 5e" foundry module to work with my Spaceships and Starwyrms system. 
This is the updated version for foundry 0.8.9, and should be used with the version of sns for that system

What it says on the tin. This module does everything that betterrolls5e does, as far as I can tell, but for my Spaceships and Starwyrms system.

To use this module, download the files in this repository and put them in a folder called "betterrollsSnS" in the "Modules" folder of your foundry AppData. 
Then, enable the module in whatever sns worlds you create. This version also requires the libWrapper module, which you can find in foundry pretty easily enough.
